# Problem Solving Approach

## Initial Approach: Brute Force Method

At the start, I tackled the problem using a brute force method. This was the simplest solution that came to mind:

1. **Power Set Creation**: I designed a way to take all the numbers and generate a power set.
2. **Nested Loop Iteration**: Using a nested loop, I iterated through the sets to check if the sum of List 1 was greater than the sum of List 2.
3. **Storing Maximum Sum**: If the condition was met, I stored List 1 (the larger list) in a variable called `max_sum` and iterated through the entire list of lists to find the maximum.

### Challenges with Brute Force
While working on this approach, I encountered issues such as indexing out of bounds and inefficiencies in the algorithm. I realized that relying solely on brute force was not an optimal solution and believed there had to be a more elegant approach.

## Seeking Guidance
To improve, I turned to ChatGPT for hints rather than a direct solution. ChatGPT posed an insightful question:

> "Do you need to create a list of lists in the first place?"

This question pushed me to rethink my approach. ChatGPT also introduced me to **Kadane's Algorithm**, a well-known method for solving maximum subarray problems.

## Implementing Kadane's Algorithm
I researched Kadane's Algorithm and learned how to implement it. This experience taught me:

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Kadane's Algorithm is a linear-time solution, making it significantly faster and more efficient than brute force.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Although I didnâ€™t get the correct implementation immediately, I refined my code iteratively.
- **Learning Opportunity**: The process exposed me to a data structure and algorithm that could be valuable in my career.

## Reflections
Through this experience, I learned the following:

- **Iterative Problem Solving**: Starting with a basic approach and refining it based on feedback.
- **Using Resources**: Seeking hints and guidance, such as from ChatGPT, can lead to valuable insights.
- **Algorithm Mastery**: Exploring Kadane's Algorithm deepened my understanding of efficient problem-solving techniques.

This problem became more than just a LeetCode exercise; it was a practical learning opportunity that broadened my skillset.
