# Solution Approach for Moving Zeros in a List

This README explains the thought process and solutions explored for a coding problem involving rearranging zeros in a list. The goal was to move all zeros in the list to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

## Initial Approach

The first approach involved using two pointers:
- One pointer at the beginning of the list and another at the end.
- If the element at the beginning was zero and the element at the end was non-zero, their positions would be swapped.
- The pointers then moved inward toward each other.

This solution was overly complicated and was abandoned in favor of a simpler approach.

## Second Approach

The second attempt involved traversing the list, removing any zeros encountered, and appending them to the end. 
This worked for most cases but failed for inputs such as `[0, 0, 1]`. The resulting output was `[0, 1, 0]`, which was incorrect because the for-loop stopped prematurely.

## Final Solution

To address the issue, the approach was refined:
1. A while loop was used instead of a for-loop to allow dynamic modification of the list.
2. A variable `i` served as the counter to iterate through the list.
3. If a zero was found, it was removed and appended to the end. The counter `i` was not incremented in this case to ensure the new element at the same index was checked.
4. A safeguard variable `j` was introduced to count the maximum number of iterations required, preventing an infinite loop.

This final solution resolved the issues and worked for all test cases.

## Reflection

While the final solution worked, it relied on multiple counters and a while-loop, which may not be the cleanest or most efficient approach. A potential improvement could involve counting the zeros in the list first and restructuring the list in a single pass.

## Example Code

```python
def move_zeros(arr):
    i, iterations = 0, len(arr)
    while iterations > 0:
        if arr[i] == 0:
            arr.pop(i)
            arr.append(0)
        else:
            i += 1
        iterations -= 1
    return arr

# Example Usage
print(move_zeros([0, 1, 0, 3, 12]))  # Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
