# **Rotate a Matrix 90 Degrees Clockwise**

## **Problem Overview**
The goal of this problem is to rotate an \( n \times n \) matrix 90 degrees clockwise **in place**. This means we must modify the input matrix directly, without allocating additional matrices or using imported libraries.

When I first encountered this problem, I recognized that there was a mathematical trick I could apply from my Matrix Algebra class. To rotate the matrix, the first step is to **transpose** the matrix, which flips it over its diagonal. However, after transposing, the result is not yet in the desired form. To complete the rotation, each row of the transposed matrix must also be reversed.

## **Solution Approach**

### **Step 1: Transpose the Matrix**
Transposing a matrix involves swapping its rows and columns. For any element at position \((i, j)\), it is swapped with the element at position \((j, i)\). This process can be achieved with a simple nested loop:

```python
matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
```

Here, we iterate through the upper triangular part of the matrix (where \(j > i\)) to avoid redundant swaps.

### **Step 2: Reverse Each Row**
After transposing the matrix, the rows must be reversed to achieve the desired rotation. This can be done using Python's slicing syntax:

```python
matrix[index] = matrix[index][::-1]
```

This line efficiently reverses the elements in each row of the matrix.

## **Challenges**
While the concept of the solution was straightforward, implementing it required careful attention to detail:
- **No Additional Memory**: The problem specifies that the rotation must be done in place, meaning all modifications happen directly on the input matrix. Allocating a new variable for the rotated matrix will result in a rejected solution on platforms like LeetCode.
- **Avoiding Libraries**: To challenge myself and demonstrate a deeper understanding of Python, I avoided using any external libraries or built-in matrix functions. This approach ensures that the logic is clear and completely custom.

## **Code Implementation**
Here is the final Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    """
    Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.
    """
    # Step 1: Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(matrix)):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]

    # Step 2: Reverse each row
    for index in range(len(matrix)):
        matrix[index] = matrix[index][::-1]
```

## **Example**

### Input:
```
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
```

### Output:
```
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]
```

## **Key Takeaways**
1. Transposing a matrix flips it over its diagonal.
2. Reversing each row of the transposed matrix completes the 90-degree clockwise rotation.
3. Understanding in-place operations is critical when solving problems with memory constraints.
